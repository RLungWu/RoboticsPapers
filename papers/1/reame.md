# DIVSCENE: Benchmarking LVLMs for Object Navigation with Diverse Scenes and Object

## Main Contribution
1. A large-scale dataset, DivScene, which contains 4,614 scenes across 81 different types.
2. End-to-end agent, NATVLM. (By finetuning LVLMs through imitation learning)
3. CoT explanation traces of the action prediction for better performance.
